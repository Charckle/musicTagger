### What?
This is a base app for managing tags for music, like artist, album, etc.

### Requirements
- Install the python requirements using pip and requirements.txt
- Install ffmpeg: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`

#### Usage
- `python main.py "Toby Keith" --album "Toby Keith"`

### To Do
Fot now, it just recursivelly tags what you selected. If a file is .m4a, it will convert it to mp3.
For the future:
- make a bash script for the instalation and running
- make the .m4a to mp3 optional
- make logs of what was done and what not
- add more possible tg changes
- make a scan to see if tags do not match one another in a folder
- make a scan to check for the correct song name on the internet
- ????
- PROFIT!
